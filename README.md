# This website was created with React

Hello! I have created this website with React JS, SASS and Swiper slider library. I have used an existing PSD layout.
Here is a list of features I would like to point out for you to better understand the workflow and the end result:

## Fully responsive layout

Though the original PSD file contained only one layout type (for large desktop screens), I have come up with my own set of solutions to optimize it for any device possible.

## React hooks

Because this project was built using functional, rather than class components, states had to be used to manage changes on the webpage. I've utilized useState, useEffect and useRef.

## React-spring

The React-Spring library was used for animation of the components on mount/unmount.

## BEM methodology

The BEM (block-element-modifier) methodology is great for predictable markup and avoiding style conflicts between components.

## SASS

Thanks to a large set of super-useful features, such as nesting, variables, ect. SASS played a crucial role in bringint this project to life. It also proved very fitting to use in conjunction with BEM methodology, as it suppornts class nesting.

## Swiper

The Swiper slider is implemented in two sections of this website, each one has its own slider type and they both have their own set of rules and breakpoints.

## JSON parsing

A landing page such as this one does not necessarily requires an API, but storing data in JSON is always a better solution than hard-coding it. I've made it so that new pricing plans, clients and service types can be added via just editing the JSON files.

Huge thanks to flaticon.com for providing extra icons that weren't in the PSD file initially!
